# Unlocker 2.0

# - Problem Description
# Consider a MxN grid of numbers. This grid represents a locked matrix. 
# You are also given a set S which has K integers. This set S is termed as Unlocking Set
# If S can be discovered in a specific fashion inside the grid then the grid can be unlocked, 
# else it is not possible to unlock the grid
# The k values in the Set S determine the dimension of a sub-matrix. Let's call it Unlocking 
# sub-matrix. Unlocking sub-matrix is square matrix contained entirely inside the larger grid 
# of dimension M N. Presence of this sub-matrix in the grid determines if the larger grid is 
# unlockable. Your task is to find this unlocking sub-matrix in the larger grid.
# The hard part about unlocking is that this Unlocking sub-matrix can be any permutation of 
# the K elements in the set S. The rules that govern the dimensions of the sub-matrix are as 
# follows
# 1. It is a square matrix
# 2. Each dimension is squareroot of Kie. Math sqrt(K)
# It is also guaranteed that all values in the unlocking set S have distinct values. Refer 
# example section to understand more about the role of permutations in the whole scheme of 
# things.
# - Constraints
# 0 <= M, N < 250
# 0 <= K < M*N
